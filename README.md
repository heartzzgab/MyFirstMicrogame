# MyFirstMicrogame

Project Title: "My First Microgame (FPS)" 

Description: This game is a first person shooter where you have to go to rooms and kill whatever enemies come to your way without dying. Ability to replenish your health is available 

Setup Instructions: N/A

Reflection: With this assignment I learnt how to use Unity where I was provided with tutorials on how to move around, find items and much  more. I learnt how to make more rooms and add walls as obstacles in said rooms. I also got to add new bots and health things that you pick up to gain more health
